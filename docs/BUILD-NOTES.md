# The Junior Experience, build notes

## Emma's live review round, 25 Aug 2026 afternoon: the pillars go up top and the page gets its bold

Emma reviewed the pass-2 draft live on WhatsApp within the hour. Eight instructions, all
applied, plus Kate's sticky menu bar. This partially reorders pass 2, and where the two
conflict, this round wins because it is later and it is hers.

**1 · The hero support lines are gone.** She circled *"THE TONE RESET FROM AED 175 / ALL
FOUR SALONS"* under the hero CTA: *needs removing*. So the only price token left above the
menu is none at all; the hero is the headline, the lede and the button.

**2 · The three pillars now open the page.** *"I want the three things I showed you of my
doc right at the top: the expertise, the rhythm, the wellness."* Expertise, Rhythm and
Wellness moved from below the menu to directly under the reframe band, in that order.
**This deliberately reverses the meeting's "offerings way higher"**; her later instruction
wins. Rhythm and Wellness are both dark and now adjacent, separated by a hairline.

**3 · The at-a-glance price list is deleted.** Her words: *"actually delete, they are
explained below, extra text we don't need."* It was pass 2's own answer to price-distance
on a phone; she would rather the cards carry it alone.

**4 · Everything she circled is bolder, on a real Playfair Display 700.** The estate only
carried the 500 weight, so *bolder* meant synthetic faux-bold or a new face. The latin 700
woff2 now ships in both asset folders at 23KB, the same budget as the 500, and the
`fonts.css` preamble regenerates into the page tree via `port.py` rather than being carried
forward stale. Card titles are upright 700 (they were italic 500), group titles 700 at up
to 31px, and the marker headings 700 at up to 40px.

**5 · The rhythm markers are black section bands.** *"These titles need to be bigger,
there's so much text, we need it to be sections almost"* and *"the black will help to tell
a story of the where-are-you vibe."* The four WHERE YOU ARE markers are now full-bleed
`--ink-deep` bands inside the menu, eyebrow in the bright accent, heading white 700.
The 100vw pull overshoots by half a scrollbar on desktop, so `body` moves from the core
sheet's `overflow-x:hidden` to `clip`, which kills the 8px of programmatic horizontal
scroll hidden still allows. **On `html` the same clip breaks position:sticky; it must stay
on body.** Tested both ways.

**6 · The blonde story moved into the menu, at the top of the colour part.** *"This is
good, it needs to go higher, at the top of the colour part maybe."* It sits after the Tone
Reset it sells and before the WHEN YOU'RE CHANGING IT marker, as a full-bleed cream band.

**7 · The jump-to chips: bolder, all visible, no sliding.** *"Needs to be bolder and not
slide across, all shown."* The row wraps instead of scrolling: two centred rows on a phone,
one on desktop. Chips carry a 1.5px ink border and invert on hover. On mobile the JUMP TO
label gives its line back to the chips, because two rows are already 96px of chrome.

**8 · May's fourteen years is off the page.** Kate asked Emma directly; Emma: *"Yeah xx...
unless we write about her."* No written consent exists to write about her, so the proof
grid is three cards: the named specialisms, the named-senior sign-off, the eight
categories. **The strongest proof point on the page is parked until the consent question
is settled**, and the build notes entry below (pass 2, section 3a) records why it was ever
here.

**Plus Kate's call: the menu bar is sticky, both directions.** A `.menu-zone` wrapper
around the bar and `#start` makes it the sticky containing block: the bar sits in its slot
above the menu at the top of the page, docks under the brand nav for as long as the menu
lasts, and scrolls away with it rather than following her into the form. `--nav-h` and
`--sticky-h` are measured in `js/nav-scroll.js` (on load, resize and after the webfont
swaps, since the chip rows reflow) so every anchor lands its heading exactly 16px clear of
the docked bar, at every width, including the two-row mobile bar.

**Verified at 375, 390, 414, 768, 1280 and 1920, both copies:** no horizontal scroll
(including the forced-scroll probe), no clipped content, every chip landing 16px clear,
the real 700 confirmed loaded via `document.fonts.check`, no console errors, copy
word-identical between the copies (3,244 words), `build.py --check` 85/85.

**Note for the environment, not the page:** the preview pane stops compositing when
hidden, so scroll and resize events never fire there. The `.stuck` shadow and re-measure
were verified by direct invocation; the mechanism is the same handler pattern as the nav
shadow that has been live for weeks.

**Still open, unchanged from pass 2:** the single blow-dry price, the colour length bands,
the standalone-toner question, the campaign close date, the Phorest volume figure, review
client consent, and the brand-guardian gate on all of this copy. **New from this round:**
if Emma wants May written about by name, that is the consent form first, then one proof
card back.

## Pass 2 on Emma's review, 25 Aug 2026: the menu is the page now

Ten action items came out of the 25 Aug meeting. All ten are on the page. The shape
of the change is that **the offerings stopped being a section near the bottom and became
the page**, with the rhythm as the thing that organises them.

**The order, and it is deliberate.** Hero, reframe band, offer nav, the menu, then the
proof. Everything that used to sit between the hero and the prices (three prose sections,
the awards, the reviews) is now below them. Emma: *"the offerings need to be way higher"*
and *"there's a lot of fluff on there about the business."* The press strip moved down to
sit with the awards and reviews, which is where credibility about the business belongs.

**The menu uses the rhythm before the Rhythm section explains it. That is on purpose.**
The H1 states the whole idea in eight words, so the markers land without the teaching
section having run first. Do not "fix" it by moving Rhythm back above the menu: the
offerings being high outranks the teaching order.

### 1 · The rhythm is the structure, not a section

Emma's master line was a heading on one section, so the page argued it once and forgot it.
It is now the spine. **Four markers group the six service groups by where she is in the
cycle**, and each card ends with one line saying where it sits.

| Marker | What sits under it |
|---|---|
| Between visits, keeping it | Blow-dries · Treatment and Blow-dry |
| Over time, repairing it | Treatment Courses |
| Week four to five, the reset | The Tone Reset |
| When you&rsquo;re changing it | Colour packages · Smoothing |

**The service names are still the headings and the nav chips.** A woman scanning for
*keratin* finds the word *keratin*; she does not have to reason about which stage of a
cycle it belongs to. Rhythm is the spine, service names are the signposts.

**The first marker is written so it holds for a woman who only ever books blow-dries**:
*"If blow-dries are the only thing you book, this is your whole rhythm, and it runs
weekly."* Without that line the device becomes a prescription that only fits blonde colour
clients, which was the one thing it must not do.

**The fourth marker is not called "the big visit"**, and this one is a correctness point
rather than a style one. Emma puts *root colours* in the junior maintenance basket and
*"your big colour"* with the experts, and both are true. Root colour is a junior
appointment and the Root Revival ships without qualification. Full colour is not settled:
the sign-off finding is that Motor City's pair do blow-dry, keratin and root colour rather
than full colour, and two of the four cards do not list colour at all. A marker called
*the big visit* reads as though juniors do the transformations. *When you're changing it*
does not, and the honest branch line stays under the colour cards.

**The blonde week 1 / 4-5 / 8 / 10 timeline stayed in the blonde section** rather than
being lifted higher as the page's own diagram. It is a blonde-specific sequence (week one
is a colour appointment), and hoisting it would have made the rhythm look like something
only colour clients have. The four markers are the page's diagram instead, distributed
rather than drawn once. **One line to change if Kate wants the timeline hoisted.**

### 2 · The reframe band, and where the conflict was

The action item wants *"These are already specialists"* capitalised near the top. That
fights *"the offerings need to be way higher"*, and the fight is settled by making the
reframe **a band rather than a section**: one capitalised line plus one supporting line,
on black, directly under the hero and above the offer nav. It costs 205px on a phone.
**The full Expertise section stays where it is, below the menu.**

The brief hoped for 60 to 90px. That is not reachable with the sentence Emma dictated,
which is four lines at 375. The padding is as tight as it goes.

**The word *trainee* now appears exactly once on the page**, in that supporting line,
because Emma dictated the sentence. It appears nowhere else. Swept and confirmed: no
*still building*, *not there yet*, *on her way*, *working towards*, *learning*,
*assistant*, *apprentice*.

### 3 · The Expertise heading was the wrong way round, and now says JUNIOR STYLISTS

Emma: *"The stylist, it needs to say junior stylist, and it needs to be bigger. It's the
wrong way around."* So **JUNIOR STYLISTS. ALREADY SPECIALISTS.** is the h2, in capitals at
50px, and *"Not trainees waiting to become something else"* dropped to the reframe band's
supporting line. Caps read larger than sentence case, so the clamp is a step below the
other h2s and still lands as the dominant heading.

**The old framework banned the word *junior* in headings. Emma has overruled that twice.
It is settled. Do not re-raise it.**

### 3a · The proof points, and the counter-intuitive one

A capitalised claim with nothing under it is a slogan, so four proof points sit under it.
**None of them names a stylist**, and that is not an oversight: written name, photo and
Instagram consent does not exist for any of the four, and the Notion register lists it as
required before any paid spend. The reviews naming three of them is a different thing,
because those are clients naming their own stylist.

| On the page | Source |
|---|---|
| Fourteen years behind the chair, five of them here | The FINAL cards, name detached |
| A named specialism each, four lists given generically | The FINAL cards |
| Signed off by a named senior | Already on the page |
| The same eight treatment categories | Already on the page |

**The years figure is the strongest asset on the list, and it used to be the fault.** The
Notion roster flagged fourteen years against a junior label as a contradiction, because the
old concept claimed juniors had *fewer years behind the chair*. Under Emma's concept the
same fact is the proof: fourteen years, in the column that does the maintenance work, is
the best available answer to *"are they experienced enough?"*. The line that broke the old
page is the evidence for this one. The card is explicit that junior describes the
appointments she is booked for, not the length of her career, because the roster is
explicit that it is not a measure of years.

**No volume figure is printed.** Emma's own caption template reads *"[Stylist Name] has
done over 400 blow-dries in the last six months"*. **400 is a placeholder and it is not on
the page.** It is the single most persuasive proof point available and it needs somebody
to pull the real number from Phorest. **Still open, and worth chasing.**

### 4 · The menu: six groups, priced, feeling before facts

Every group carries Emma's own three-part emotional map from Section 02 of her playbook:
what she feels, what she needs to believe, how she feels leaving. Then the cards carry the
facts. **Feeling before facts, never a service description first.** Each group also carries
its pillar as a tag, so **Expertise · Rhythm · Wellness** are visible as the campaign rather
than named once in a brief.

Two lines are close to verbatim from her document because they do the selling on their own:
*"By session three, the repair is visible"* on the courses, and on the colour packages, that
she is not spending more, she is protecting what she already spends.

**Six groups, not seven.** The action list splits *toners* from *toner + blow dry* and
*root colours* from *colour packages*. In Emma's document there is one toner product, the
Tone Reset, which **is** toner plus a blow-dry, and root colour is sold as the Root Revival
inside the colour group. Her own spoken list was the six. So: six chips, the words *root
colour* are inside the Root Revival card, and *toner* is in the toner group's heading, so
nobody scanning for either misses it. **Seven chips is a one-line change if Kate says so.**

**The 10-blow-dry package at 850 is off the page.** Emma asked for it removed or given a
validity, and no validity exists. **No percentage ships**: her *(20% off)* and *(25% off)*
are internal names and doctrine auto-fails `% off` in client copy.

### 5 · Price visibility, and the one place the brief and the build disagreed

Two rules pull against each other. Feeling before facts puts three paragraphs of emotional
copy above the first card. Price visibility wants numbers early. Built as written, **the
first price sat 1,400px below the top of the menu on a 375 screen**, which fails the brief
it was written to satisfy.

**The fix is an at-a-glance list at the top of the menu**: six rows, six prices, each row
the anchor to its own group. Every price is now within 390px of the menu heading, the
emotional copy keeps its position, and nothing changed about the order of the cards. It
lives inside `#start`, so the rule that no price appears above the menu still holds.
Verified: the only price token above `#start` is the hero's AED 175.

**On the cards: the "from" price is always on the face, at 33px, never inside a
disclosure.** Only the four-band breakdown collapses, and only where bands exist (the two
blow-dry bundles and the Tone Reset). The treatments, the courses and the smoothing carry
their full priced lists open on the face, because those are per-item prices rather than
length bands.

### 6 · More black

Emma: *"it's too beige... looks too vanilla, and we don't like vanilla."* The page had one
dark band, the FAQ. It now has five: **the reframe, Rhythm, Wellness, the Confidence
Promise and the FAQ.** All use the existing `.dark` component, no new colours. The menu,
the reviews, the awards and the form stay on light, because people compare prices and read
proof on light and dense reading on black in daylight is a legibility problem.

**In every dark section the body weight goes 300 to 400 and the body colour lifts to
`rgba(255,255,255,.82)`**, because this page is mostly read on a phone outdoors.

### 7 · The hero was misaligned, and it was not taste

`.hero-b` was `padding:0` with a full-bleed `1fr 1fr` split while every other section
rendered inside the centred `.wrap`. At 1920 the hero text started at the viewport edge and
everything below started 388px in. Emma: *"it looks a bit wonky for a start, it's not in
the middle."*

**The split now sits in the same container as the rest of the page.** Measured at every
width: the campaign label's left edge and the section content's left edge are the same
number. 68 at 1280, 388 at 1920, 26 at 768, 20 at 375 and 390.

**"The Junior Experience" is a campaign label now, not an eyebrow.** It was 12.5px fine
print above a 52px headline; it is 16.5px on a phone and 22px on desktop.

### 8 · Mobile, and it was not the last step

Kate's ruling: the phone is the primary screen and every screen type has to work. Designed
and checked at 375 and 390 first, then widened. **Verified at 375, 390, 414, 768, 1024,
1280 and 1920**, on both copies:

- No horizontal page scroll at any width. `document.documentElement.scrollWidth` never
  exceeds the viewport.
- Nothing clipped: no element inside `<main>` overflows its own box except the offer-nav
  chip row, which is the intended horizontal scroller, and the native country-code select.
- Every chip lands its group heading 19px clear of the 75px sticky nav. `scroll-margin-top`
  is 94px on all six targets.
- Every form control is 16px, which is also what stops iOS zooming on focus.
- Every card CTA still prefills the form. All nine tested; `offering`, `branch`, `emirate`
  and `campaign` still derive correctly.
- The rail images are still `3/4` above 559px and `4/5` below. Untouched.
- No console errors on either copy.

### Three resolutions applied, from the brief

**1 · Price-forward layout, never price-framed copy.** Emma said in the meeting that
*people go to juniors because it's cheaper*. Her own SAY THIS / NOT THIS table bans that
sentence, and Kate ruled it out of client-facing material. So the numbers are large and
early and the words never say cheap, discount, save, or compare to senior pricing. Swept
and confirmed clean. **The load-bearing sentence ships once, in Expertise and nowhere
else:** they are as capable as anyone in the salon at the appointments they do, their
columns are built with more room in them, so there is time to look at your hair properly
before anything starts.

Two deliberate departures from Kate's wording, both to keep it true. *"as capable at the
appointments they do"* rather than flat parity, because the roster records that the cohort
is not signed off on everything and an unqualified claim about named employees would be
checkable and false. And *"columns are built with more room in them"* rather than *"not as
fully booked"*, which is the same fact stated as the client's benefit rather than as a
ranking of the stylist. **That second one is the mechanism Emma rejected in the first
draft**, where being less booked was the junior's whole value. Here competence is the claim
and time is the benefit. It is kept to one place on purpose. If Emma pushes back a second
time, this is why.

**2 · The single blow-dry price is not on the page.** Her document says *from AED 150*.
Her own new grid prices three at 240 for Short, which is 80 each, and at her stated 20% off
implies a Short single of 100. Publishing 150 beside 240 lets a client compute a 47%
discount on a page where discount framing auto-fails. **The bundles ship, the single does
not.** One line under the group says the salon will confirm the price for her length.
**Emma confirms 100 and it is one line here.**

**3 · No comparison with the senior team.** She said in the meeting that the juniors are
better at blow-drying than our stylists. True in-house, and on a public page it puts the
senior team down, which is her own rule against. **The page ships the non-comparative
form**: they do more blow-dries than anyone else in the salon. Swept: the word *senior*
appears on this page only as *signed off by a named senior*.

### Emma's document was checked for newer changes before the menu was built

Action item 10 asked her to refresh the shared link. `JUNIOR EMMA AUG 26 - edited.docx`
was diffed again in full before any price was written. **Nothing is newer than the copy the
brief quotes**: the blow-dry grid, the membership cap, the 10-pack question and the Tone
Reset reprice are the same three Section 02 edits. **AED 130 still stands in nine places in
her own document** and has to agree before the WhatsApp templates enter the Meta queue.

### Two small copy corrections made in passing

- **The In the chair heading said *"a proper look"***, which is the retired campaign name in
  lowercase. It now reads *"Every appointment starts by looking at your hair properly."*
- **The eyebrow numbering was stale** after the reorder. The numbers are gone rather than
  renumbered, and the section eyebrows are words.
- **The meta description still described the removed spine** (the hour, the water, the
  written plan). Rewritten, in all three places it appears, plus the Service `serviceType`.

### The two copies had drifted, and the drift was the whole concept

`tara-rose-pages-main/junior-experience/index.html` was **still on the retired concept**:
*"Nobody will be watching the clock"*, the AED 300 hour in the hero and in four schema
nodes, a FAQ about how a full column is booked to the minute, and the *"Less booked, not
less careful"* answer. The 25 Aug rebuild landed in the standalone repo and never got
ported. **Both copies are now generated from the standalone by one script**, so this cannot
drift silently again: the tree copy differs only in the `/tara-rose-pages` prefix, the
inlined JS and build.py's CSS carrier.

Verified: **3,331 words of visible copy, identical in both**, every meta tag identical,
`python build.py --check` reports 85/85 pages matching, and the tree copy renders to the
same measurements at 375 and 1280.

### Still open after this pass

- **The single blow-dry price**, and the **length bands for colour**. Neither is invented.
- **The real blow-dry volume figure per stylist**, from Phorest. Emma's own template wants
  it and it is the strongest proof point available.
- **Is there a standalone toner**, without a blow-dry? The meeting notes list it separately;
  her document has only the Tone Reset, which includes the blow-dry. No price exists for a
  standalone anywhere. **Ask before adding a seventh group.**
- **What the page says about the campaign ending.** The *"not an introductory rate"* line
  went with the old concept and nothing replaced it, so the page has no answer to *"will it
  go up?"* — which the framework calls the quiet killer of the in-chair rebook.
- **One WhatsApp number is serving all four branches.**
- **`trs-brand-guardian` has not seen any of the new copy**, and this pass is almost
  entirely new client-facing copy.
- **Nobody has confirmed the four review clients consented** to appear on a public page.
- **Written name, photo and Instagram consent for the four stylists** is still required
  before any paid spend, which is why the proof points carry no names.

### Settled, do not reopen

- **Tara's five-layer framework no longer drives this page.** Kate's call, 25 Aug: follow
  Emma, handle Tara's revisions if and when she gives them. The unhurried hour, the senior
  column booked to the minute and the AED 300 diagnostic hour are gone from both copies.
- **The word *junior* in headings.** Overruled twice by Emma. It is the campaign name.
- **The five step labels stay First / Then / After that / Next / Last, with no digits.** A
  numbered five beside the 8-Step Hair Plan re-creates the retired 5-Step Consultation.
- **The Confidence Promise wording, the four reviews, the photographs and the tracking
  vocabulary are untouched.** So is `noindex,nofollow`.

---

## Four reviews, one per junior stylist, 25 Aug 2026

Kate asked for more, and suggested the Google Business Profile. **GBP would not give up its
review list.** Maps serves a "limited view" without a session, and signed in as the profile
owner neither the Maps place panel nor the Search knowledge panel exposes the review text to
automation, only the count: Al Quoz shows 5.0 from 414. **The reviews are readable by hand in
the browser, so if a specific one is wanted, paste it and it goes on in a minute.**

**What was readable: the other two FINAL cards.** So the section is now four reviews, one per
named junior stylist, covering all three delivering branches.

| Review | Stylist | Branch | Span used |
|---|---|---|---|
| Elizabeth | Areanne | Al Quoz | The consultation sentence, which is this page's promise in a client's words |
| Asma | Irlyn | Khalifa City | *"She made me feel comfortable, explained everything, and did such a beautiful job."* A first-time colour client who was nervous |
| Marta | Eds | Mamsha Al Saadiyat | The opening two sentences, which are the strongest hook in the set |
| An | May | Khalifa City | Talent and kindness in one appointment |

Heading changed from *Two reviews* to *Four reviews*. The layout needed nothing: the grid is
`auto-fit minmax(260px,1fr)` inside 760px, so four cards fall into 2x2.

**How the two known faults were handled, because the framework says neither can just ship.**

- **Irlyn's review thanks "Lynn" twice.** Rather than print a mismatch or drop the review, the
  span used contains **no name at all**, and the attribution carries Irlyn. The visible problem
  is gone; **the underlying question, whether she goes by Lynn with clients, is still open** and
  is `trs-proof-builder`'s, per the Stylist roster page.
- **Eds's review contains the typo *"Atfer months"*.** The span used stops before it, so
  nothing is silently corrected and no `[sic]` is needed. **It still spells her name "Edz"
  while the attribution says Eds**, which is a one-letter variance of her own nickname rather
  than a different name, so it is left as the client wrote it. If brand review wants them
  identical, it is one word either way.

Both new quotes are contiguous spans, like the first two. Nothing is stitched, because the
heading says *word for word*.

**Still unsigned, and it now covers four clients rather than two:** nobody has confirmed in
writing that these reviewers consented to their words on a public page. It sits with the
claims table.

---

## Three small ones, 25 Aug 2026

**The first rail card was off-centre.** The pair sat right of the middle with dead mirror
space on the left. Recut at cx 0.48 and 88% of the height, so the two faces straddle the
centre line and fill the frame. Judged against a drawn centre line rather than by eye.

**Three THENs in a row read as filler**, and Kate asked for it to be counted instead.
**It is now First / Then / After that / Next / Last, and the digits are deliberately absent.**
Numbering these five is exactly what brand review blocked on 21 Aug: a numbered five beside
the **8-Step Hair Plan** re-creates the retired *5-Step Consultation*, which
`.claude/rules/client-facing-content.md` says must not be restored. Five distinct words carry
the sequence with no count implied. **If Tara wants real numerals, that is her call plus the
brand gate, and it is one line here.**

**Every small-caps label was fine print.** Eyebrows, the hero support chips, the price labels,
the rail captions and the step words were set at 10 to 12px. All up one step, with
letter-spacing eased so the wider glyphs do not add a line on a phone: `.eyebrow` 11 to 12.5,
`.tstep .wk` 10 to 11.5, form labels 12 to 13, consent 13 to 14, stars 13 to 14, nav links
11.5 to 12.5. Six of those live in `trs-core.css` and `trs-blocks.css`, which are shared and
must not be forked, so they are overridden in the page sheet.

---

## The hero, 25 Aug 2026: it was not a junior stylist either

Same rule as the rail, applied to the largest photograph on the page. `hero-mapping.jpg`
showed the senior team, so the page opened by promising the junior column and illustrating it
with someone else.

**Now `hero-junior.jpg`, from `BRIT8563`** in Tara's `JUNIOR STYLIST` folder: a junior stylist
finishing her client's hair, the client smiling straight at the camera. It was chosen against
the two shapes the hero actually renders in, a roughly 1.4:1 panel on desktop and a 1.9:1 band
under 833px, both `cover`, and it holds in both at the existing `center 30%`. 1600x1066 at
184KB, the same budget as the file it replaces. `hero-mapping.jpg` is deleted from this repo
and stays in the page tree, where other pages still use it.

Rejected: `BRIT7431` reads as the salon floor rather than one appointment, and `BRIT2650` and
`BRIT7419` both have the client's face turned away.

**The OG image now exists.** `og/junior-experience.jpg`, 1200x630 at 86KB, from the same frame,
so a shared link stops rendering blank. **The meta tag still points at
`https://www.tararosesalon.com/og/junior-experience.jpg?v=1`**, the production domain, which is
correct and deliberate: LID mounts the page there. That means the preview stays blank on the
Pages URL and starts working the day LID takes the folder, with the file already in it.

Alt text and `og:image:alt` both rewritten, since they described the old photograph.

---

## Reading size and the reviews, 25 Aug 2026

**The body copy was a step too small** beside a 52px headline, so it is one step up
throughout: section prose 16 to 17px, the hero sub-line's clamp from 15-17 to 16-18.5,
door descriptions 14.5 to 15.5, menu lede 15 to 16, menu note 14.5 to 15.5, availability
16 to 17, the form's help text 12.5 to 13.5, and the review cards, the timeline and the FAQ
answers overridden to match. **`.tcard`, `.tstep` and `.faq .ans` live in `trs-blocks.css`,
which is the shared design system and must not be forked**, so they are overridden in the
page stylesheet instead. Incidentally the selects and textarea moved 15 to 16px, which also
retires the iOS zoom-on-focus that a 15px control causes.

**The reviews were the wrong stylists, and Kate caught it: Zandri is a senior stylist.**
A page selling the junior column was proving itself with a review of the senior team, and the
second review named nobody at all. Both are replaced with real five-star reviews of named
junior stylists, verbatim from the FINAL cards, one per emirate:

- **Elizabeth on Areanne, Al Quoz.** A first-time client, and the sentence that matters is
  *"really took the time to find out my hair concerns and gave a great recommendation for my
  hair type"*. That is this page's entire promise, in a client's own words rather than ours.
- **An on May, Khalifa City.** *"Not only is she incredibly talented, but she is also so kind
  and made the whole appointment such a pleasure."*

Both are contiguous spans, not stitched from separate sentences, because the section heading
says *word for word* and it has to be true. **The attributions now carry the stylist and the
branch**, which is what makes them proof of the junior column rather than of the salon.

**Two reviews deliberately not used, on the framework's own findings.** Irlyn's card review
thanks *"Lynn"* twice, and a page that names her Irlyn while quoting a review about Lynn reads
as manufactured proof. Eds's carries the typo *"Atfer months"*, which cannot be silently
corrected and needs either a `[sic]` or the reviewer's permission. Both are recorded on the
Stylist roster page in Notion, and both need `trs-proof-builder`, not a developer.

**Still unsigned:** these are real reviews from the cards, but nobody has confirmed in writing
that the clients consented to their words appearing on a public page. It sits with the rest of
the claims table.

## Photography, 25 Aug 2026: the rail was the voucher campaign's photography, and then it was the wrong stylists

Two faults, found in that order, both by Kate on the live page.

**One. The three rail photographs were the Wellness Voucher pack's**, byte for byte:
`exp-authentic.jpg`, `exp-colour.jpg` and `exp-people.jpg` all ship in
`wellness-voucher-approval-pack/assets/`. Two campaigns to the same client list, six weeks
apart, on the same pictures.

**Two, and this is the one that mattered. The replacements did not show junior stylists.**
A page about the junior team was illustrated with senior and front-of-house staff. The
photography brief in the framework never said it, because nobody thought it needed saying,
and it is the whole point of the page: **the woman in the picture has to be one of the ten**.

**Where the junior team actually is photographed.** Not in the dashboard's `assets/staff/work/`
set, which is `may-*`, `irlyn-*`, `eds-*` and `areanne-*` but is photographs of their *work*,
finished hair shot from behind, at 300px with a mint border baked in. The real sources are
Tara's `TARA FOUND IMAGES > JUNIOR STYLIST` folder, four frames, and the frames inside
Marish's `stylists working images` where the junior team is the one working.

| Slot | File | Source | Who and what |
|---|---|---|---|
| She listens first | `consult-listens.jpg` | `BRIT1220` (marish@) | A junior stylist and her client at the chair, gloved and ready, both talking. The moment before anything starts |
| Then she looks properly | `consult-looks.jpg` | `BRIT4993` (marish@) | Both hands lifting the client's hair, checking it, client smiling. This is the examination, exactly as the section describes it |
| Then she explains it | `consult-explains.jpg` | `BRIT6639` (tara@, JUNIOR STYLIST) | **Irlyn**, name badge legible in frame, showing her client the treatment pot and tube. She is Khalifa City's junior stylist, so the provenance is not an assumption |

**Rejected on the way, and worth writing down.** `BRIT0317` and `BRIT6035`, the first
replacements, are good photographs of the wrong people. `CLIENT_INTERACTION10` has a male
client, and this is a ladies salon. `BRIT6439` has a male stylist, and the junior cohort is
ten women.

**The crops are composed for the phone, not the desktop card.** `.hour-rail img` is
`aspect-ratio:3/4` above 559px and **`16/10` below it**, with `object-fit:cover`, so a phone
shows only the middle 42% of the height of each 546x820 file. An earlier pass was cropped for
desktop and beheaded two of the three on mobile. Final geometry, all full height from
originals at 6720px or 5783px wide, so roughly 3x the pixels needed: listens at cx 0.32,
looks at cx 0.55, explains at cx 0.40. Every one checked at both ratios before shipping.

**Crop fix, same day.** Kate again: the photographs were right and the framing was ugly.
Two causes, and the second was the real one.

1. **The files were 2:3 and the card is 3:4**, so the browser was quietly trimming 5.5% off
   the top and bottom of a composition made without seeing it. Two of the three lost the top
   of a head that way. **The files are now 546x728, the card's own ratio**, so what is
   composed is what ships. `width`/`height` in the markup moved with them.
2. **The mobile rule was `aspect-ratio:16/10`**, a landscape band driven through a portrait
   photograph, showing the middle 42% of the height. It beheaded whoever was standing up,
   which in every one of these frames is the stylist. **Now `4/5`, which shows 94%.** The rail
   is a single column under 560px, so there was never a reason for it to be letterboxed.

Final framing, full height, horizontal centre only: listens cx 0.40, looks cx 0.50, explains
cx 0.48. Checked as rendered cards at 3:4 and 4:5, not as raw files.

**Four files deleted from this repo:** the three reused ones plus `exp-floor.jpg`, unused
since the hero changed. They stay in the page tree, where the Bahrain founding page and the
beauty voucher page still use them. **This supersedes the Photography section further down**,
which asked for `1.png`, `BRIT6639.jpg` and `10.png`. It was half right: `BRIT6639` is in.

**Still open:** the hero is still `hero-mapping.jpg` and does not show a junior stylist
either, the founder portrait is untouched, and the OG image at `/og/junior-experience.jpg`
still does not exist, so every share renders blank.

---

## Sixth pass, 25 Aug 2026: the reprice is applied, and the rhythm has a section

Kate's go-ahead, on the edited playbook being the basis from here.

**1 · The Tone Reset is AED 175, not 130.** Two edits, as scoped: the card in `#start` and
the `minPrice` on the Tone Reset offer in the JSON-LD. Nothing else on the page carried the
number. **The seven prices are now 300 · 175 / 150 / 240 · 380 / 570 / 620.**

**This creates one hard deadline rather than a task.** 130 still stands in nine places in
Emma's own playbook: the offerings line, the blonde rhythm table, the Blonde Story body,
four WhatsApp scripts, a social caption and the Toner Google ad. It also has to be the
number on the Phorest service type. **All of it has to agree before the WhatsApp templates
enter the Meta queue**, because that is the point after which the name and the price cannot
change. Lane 2 ads go out this week, so the ad copy is the urgent one.

**2 · Emma's master line now appears on the page.** New `#rhythm` section between
`#availability` and `#start`, headed *"Great hair isn't one visit. It's a rhythm."*, which is
the idea her whole campaign sits under and which this page did not contain at all. It also
gives the **Blonde Story** somewhere to land: her hook, her week-four warmth, her
*"week eight can look like week one"*, written to the page's voice rather than pasted.

- **It carries no price**, deliberately. It sits above `#start`, where the rule is that any
  number above that point is a defect. Verified: the only price token above `#start` is the
  hero's AED 300, exactly as before.
- Placed at `stone-soft` so the cream/paper alternation still holds either side of it.
- Verified at 1280 and 375: no overflow inside the section, no page scroll, JSON-LD still
  parses, no console errors.
- **It is new client-facing copy**, so it goes through the `trs-brand-guardian` gate with
  the rest of the page. The master line itself is Emma's, verbatim.

---

## What "it runs to the end of the year" changes, 25 Aug

New from Kate, and **it is not written down anywhere yet**: neither the playbook nor the
framework carries a close date. Notion's own default (item 9, L2) is *"there is no close
date, so no urgency language ships at all"*, overridable any time. **A launch on 21 Sep and
a close on 31 Dec is a fourteen-week run**, and four things follow that nobody has ruled on.

**1 · The load-bearing sentence on this page assumes the price is permanent.** In `#start`:
*"Not an introductory rate: it's what an appointment with her costs, for as long as you book
her."* That is the locked Belief 5 line, and it is the one that kills the *"will it go up?"*
objection the framework calls the quiet killer of the in-chair rebook. **If these are
campaign prices that revert on 1 January, that sentence is false and has to come out**, and
the page loses its answer to the biggest objection on it. If they are simply the junior
price list, the sentence stands and "the campaign ends" only means the marketing stops.
**Emma. One line, and it decides whether a locked sentence survives.**

**2 · Same problem, smaller, in `#availability`:** *"this is not a window we reopen on a
schedule."* True of hours that vanish as the books fill. Not true of a campaign that closes
in December and re-runs in 2027.

**3 · Prepaid money crosses the close date, and nothing says what happens to it.** The x3
and x5 bundles, the treatment courses, the four-week membership and the 10-pack are all
prepaid, and the page sells the bundle as *"prepaid"* in as many words. Sessions bought in
November are redeemed in January. **Emma has already asked for a validity on the 10-pack; the
same question applies to all of them.** Without a written rule, unredeemed sessions become a
front-desk argument in January, and Notion item 15 (L2) already treats prepaid course cash as
deferred revenue tracked weekly. **No validity has been invented here.**

**4 · Two calendar consequences.** The voucher-collision work covered 15 to 30 September
only; a run to year end means the whole Q4 calendar needs the same check, on the same four
branch numbers, and Emma owns both. And **what happens to the page itself on 31 December**
belongs in the LID hand-off: it stays live, or it comes down with a redirect target. LID
mounts the page and holds the 301s, so if the hand-off is silent, January leaves a live
campaign page nobody owns.

**Nothing about the close date has been written into the page.** Urgency copy is now
unlocked and is not honest four months out; it is a December action, and it should be a
decision rather than a drift.

---

## Emma's edited playbook, 25 Aug 2026: three changes, one of them a price on this page

`JUNIOR EMMA AUG 26 - edited.docx` replaces the version the fifth pass was read against.
Diffed in full: **three substantive edits, all in Section 02, all written as questions to
us rather than decisions.** Everything else is identical apart from one table in Section 08
reflowing its keyword cells onto single lines.

**1 · The blow-dry package grid, new, and it settles our AED 240.**

| Package | Short / Fine | Medium | Long / Thick | Extra Long |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| The Blowdry Edit x3 | 240 | 288 | 336 | 432 |
| The Blowdry Series x5 | 375 | 450 | 525 | 675 |

**So *Three from AED 240* on the page is correct** and the fifth pass's fault 4 is closed:
240 is the Short/Fine band, not a mis-typed 360. **What it exposes instead** is that the
grid implies a single junior blow-dry of AED 100 at Short (240 ÷ 3 ÷ 0.8), while her own
body line and her Google ad both say *single blowdry from AED 150*. One of those two is
wrong, and only the single price is advertised anywhere. **The page carries neither**, so
nothing here blocks it.

**Her labels carry percentages.** `x3 (20% off)` and `x5 (25% off)` are fine as internal
names and auto-fail as client copy. The page's *Three from AED 240* stays as it is.

**2 · The membership is capped and the 10-pack is questioned.** "Unlimited 4-week" becomes
**two blow-dries a week across four weeks, from AED 799**, which retires an open-ended
promise nobody could staff. The 10-blow-dry package at AED 850 she wants **removed, or
given a validity**. Neither is on the page, so this changes nothing here yet, but if either
ever reaches the page the word *unlimited* cannot come with it.

**3 · The Tone Reset reprice, and this one touches the page.** She reads the published
130 / 180 / 230 / 330 as more than 50% off and proposes a 30%-off computation instead:
**Short 175 · Medium 225 · Long 275 · Extra Long 380.**

- **On the page it is two edits:** the Tone Reset card, *From AED 130*, and the `minPrice`
  on the Tone Reset offer in the schema. Nothing else on the page repeats the number.
- **In her own document it is nine.** 130 still stands in the offerings line, the blonde
  rhythm table, the Blonde Story body, four WhatsApp scripts, a social caption and the
  Toner Google ad. **Repricing is not a one-cell change**, and the ads are Lane 2, going
  out this week.
- **The framework agrees with her instinct.** Layer 2's own table rates "From AED 130" at
  1.2x and marks it *Fails, deep red*. At 175 it clears into a defensible band. This is the
  one edit that improves the commercial model rather than only the optics.
- **Not applied.** It is phrased as a question, and it moves a published price. **One word
  from Emma and it is two lines here plus a pass over her own nine.**

---

## Fifth pass, 25 Aug 2026: checked against Emma's playbook, four faults fixed

Kate asked for the page to be read against two sources at once: the Notion framework and
**Emma's own campaign playbook**, `JUNIOR EMMA AUG 26.docx`, which is the document the
social, WhatsApp and paid lanes are actually being run from. Ten mismatches came out of it.
**Four were fixable without anybody's sign-off and are done, in both copies.**

1. **The retired campaign name was still in client-facing copy.** Both WhatsApp prefills
   said *"I read about A Proper Look"*. The name was overruled on 24 Aug and these two
   strings were missed. Now *"I read about The Junior Experience"*.
2. **The branch tag never fired from her own form.** `branch` was read from the URL only,
   which is right for the four GBP profiles and wrong for everything else: a click from
   Instagram, a caption link or a stylist's own bio arrived with no branch at all, and
   Emma's spec wants a branch tag on every lead at creation. Her salon choice now fills it
   in Emma's vocabulary (`abudhabi` / `dubai-alquoz` / `dubai-motorcity`). **A `?branch=`
   on the URL still wins**, so GBP attribution is untouched. *"Either Dubai salon is fine"*
   has no tag in her list, so it is left blank rather than guessed; the `salon` field still
   carries what she said.
3. **`offering:treatment-course` could never fire.** Treatment courses are one of the six
   required offering tags, a whole offering group in her playbook, and one of her ten KPIs
   (Treatment Course Conversion, 20%). The reason select had no course option, so a course
   lead was untaggable and the KPI had no source. Added as *"A course of treatments, three
   or five"*, mapped to `treatment-course`. **No course price was added to the menu**, on
   purpose: see the blow-dry arithmetic below, which is the same unresolved problem.
4. **The page sold colour at four salons.** The sign-off default in force (close-out item
   84) is that each stylist is bookable only for the families on her own card, which puts
   full colour at Khalifa City only, and Motor City's pair at root colour rather than full.
   The menu offered The Root Revival and The Colour Immersion with no branch limit and the
   salon select allowed any pairing, so Saadiyat plus Colour Immersion was bookable. One
   honest line now sits above the price-band note. **It goes away the day the sign-off
   table exists**, which is half an hour of Ruth's time.

Verified in a browser: course at Saadiyat gives `offering:treatment-course` +
`branch:abudhabi`, smoothing at Motor City gives `smooth-edit` + `dubai-motorcity`, a GBP
link keeps its own branch, "not sure" clears every derived field, both prefills carry the
new name, no console errors, no horizontal scroll.

### The six that were not ours to fix

Left for Emma and Tara, and the first two are the expensive ones.

| # | What | Whose call |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Two entry prices are live at once.** Emma's playbook has no charged diagnostic hour and no AED 300 anywhere; her entry points are the Tone Reset from 130 and Treatment plus Blow-dry from 150. The page still leads on the hour in the hero and as the featured card | Emma. One command either way |
| 2 | **The master line is missing.** *"Great hair isn't one visit. It's a rhythm."* is the idea her whole campaign sits under and it is going out on Lane 1 social now. The word *rhythm* appears nowhere on this page, so the ads and the page read as two campaigns | Emma, then a copy pass |
| 3 | **The Blonde Story has nowhere to land.** She runs a dedicated Meta blonde audience with its own hook pointing at the Tone Reset. This page has no mention of blonde, brassiness or the week-four toner. The card is here; the story that sells it is not | Emma, then a new section |
| 4 | **The blow-dry arithmetic does not reconcile. ANSWERED 25 Aug** by the package grid in her edited playbook, above: AED 240 is the Short/Fine band for the x3 and the page is right. What is left is her *single blowdry from AED 150* against a grid that implies 100 at Short, and the course prices, which are still unpublished | Her single-blow-dry band, and a course grid |
| 5 | **The senior-column framing breaks her rule.** Her SAY THIS / NOT THIS table says we never put senior stylists down. The hero premise, section 3 and the founder block all say a senior column is booked to the minute and cuts the consultation first. Already on the escalation list from 21 Aug | Tara. Her words or not at all |
| 6 | **Her no-jargon rule** against *"mineral load, scalp, porosity and bond"*, which is not explained in plain English immediately after | Copy pass, with the brand gate |

**One open question created by fix 2, and it is a real one.** If a woman arrives on an Al
Quoz GBP link and then selects Khalifa City, `branch` stays `dubai-alquoz` (attribution)
while `emirate` says `abudhabi` (her answer). The two tags disagree on purpose and the
`salon` field carries the truth, so reception can see it. If Emma would rather her stated
salon won the routing tag, that is one line, and it costs the GBP-profile attribution.

**Still open from earlier passes, unchanged:** the OG image at `/og/junior-experience.jpg`
does not exist, so every share renders blank; the founder block is Tara's first person but
not Tara's words; the claims table nobody has signed off; and the formal
`trs-brand-guardian` gate runs on the preview URL before hand-off. The colour note added in
fix 4 is new client-facing copy and goes through that gate with everything else.

---

## Fourth revision, 24 Aug 2026: the price menu is combined

Kate's call: combine the two menus. It fixes more than it merges. The framework's three
doors were abstractions, and one of them was **not a real product**: "Door 2 at AED 400"
appears in no price list anywhere. The named menu does.

**Seven priced items, two groups.** Between visits: The Tone Reset from 130, Treatment and
Blow-dry from 150, The Blow-dry Bundle of three from 240. The bigger visits: The Root
Revival from 380, The Colour Immersion from 570, The Smooth Edit from 620. The consultation
hour at AED 300 stays as the featured card above both. Schema offers rebuilt to match.

**AED 130 is not an introductory price, and this was worth checking before writing it.**
The July price tables run 130 / 180 / 230 / 330 by length, so it is the Short/Fine price and
"from" is accurate. Had it been introductory it would have contradicted the locked Belief 5
sentence already on this page, *"Not an introductory rate: it's what an appointment with her
costs, for as long as you book her"*, which is the line that kills the "will it go up?"
objection the framework calls the quiet killer of the in-chair rebook.

**Added the band note**, that every price is a starting price which rises with length and
thickness, and that the stylist says which band before booking rather than at the till. That
closes a gap: a From price the front desk has to walk up is the same fault the framework
killed elsewhere.

**New hidden field `offering`**, using Emma's exact GHL tag vocabulary (`toner-reset`,
`treatment-blowdry`, `blowdry`, `colour-package`, `smooth-edit`), so the page feeds her
pipeline with no translation step. `product` stays look-versus-door, which is what Layer 4
measures the conversion on.

**One bug the browser test caught.** `set()` deliberately ignores an empty value, which is
correct for a UTM that arrives once and must not be wiped by a later empty read, and wrong
for a derived field. Picking The Smooth Edit and then changing to "not sure" was sending
`offering:smooth-edit` to GHL for a woman who had just said she did not know. The three
derived fields now assign unconditionally.

Verified at 375 and desktop: no horizontal scroll, nothing overflowing in the menu, tap
targets 52px, FAQ schema still mirrors the page byte for byte, no console errors.

**The repo is now `katealsaybar/the-junior-experience`.**

---

## Third revision, 24 Aug 2026: the name is The Junior Experience

**Emma-Louise's call as GM, and it overrides the framework's rename.** The framework retired
The Junior Experience with four arguments and replaced it with A Proper Look. Emma's own
playbook kept the original name throughout, including the hashtag in four caption templates,
and her Lane 1 posts today. So the name is settled and the framework's argument 4, that
*junior* must never appear in a URL, is overruled with it.

Applied: `/en/ae/junior-experience/`, the title, all social meta, the eyebrow, the footer
heading, the FAQ, the `campaign:junior-experience-2026` tag matching Emma's GHL spec, and the
session ref prefix, now `JE-`. `css/a-proper-look.css` becomes `css/junior-experience.css`,
and in the inlined tree the folder and `_css/page-junior-experience.css` moved with it.

**Two copy calls made rather than asked, both reversible in one line:**

1. **Buttons say "Book an appointment", not "Book The Junior Experience"**, which does not
   read as a thing a person books.
2. **The AED 300 hour lost its name and kept its description.** It was called A Proper Look,
   which was both the campaign and the product. With the campaign renamed, the hour has no
   name, and inventing one is not a build decision. It reads as "An hour that is only about
   your hair" until somebody names it or drops it.

**The open question this leaves, and it is the real one.** Emma's playbook contains no charged
diagnostic hour and no AED 300. Its entry points are a Tone Reset from AED 130 and a Treatment
plus Blowdry from AED 150, sold on rhythm. This page's primary card is a AED 300 hour sold on
diagnosis. **A page named after her campaign should probably sell her offers.** Either the hour
survives as an addition to her menu, or the card comes out and the three doors carry the page.
That is one command either way, and it needs Emma rather than a developer.

---


## Second revision, 24 Aug 2026, afternoon: Motor City is in

Emma supplied the full staff list. Every count in the framework was built on four
stylists at three branches. It is **ten people at four branches, in two grades**:

- **Junior stylists (6):** May and Irlyn at Khalifa City, Eds Asuncion at Saadiyat,
  Areanne at Al Quoz, Clarissa Destacamento and Xyrhy Unisa at Motor City.
- **Blowdry specialists (4):** Helen Lita and Myra Sarmiento at Saadiyat, Hazel Mae and
  Mevil at Khalifa City. Areanne, Clarissa and Xyrhy are dual-graded.

Eds and Edz are the same person. One spelling: Eds.

Applied to the page:

- **Motor City added** to the salon select, the footer, and as a fourth `LocalBusiness`
  node with its own `areaServed`. The Layer 5 spec built this as a one-boolean change and
  that is exactly what it cost.
- **The Motor City holding sentence and the waiting-list checkbox are gone.** They existed
  because the branch could not deliver. It can.
- **"Either Dubai salon is fine" comes back.** Layer 5 C3 retired it when there was one
  Dubai salon. There are two again.
- **Hero support line** is now "All four salons, Abu Dhabi and Dubai" rather than three
  named branches. This also settles Layer 5 item 51: the "four salons" trust claim used to
  sit beside a three-salon selector and read as an error. They agree now.
- **`emirate` derivation** covers al-quoz, motor-city and either-dubai as Dubai.
- The FAQ answer on which salons run it, in the page and in the FAQPage schema.

**Not applied, because it is not the page's call:** Motor City's two are blowdry, keratin
and root colour rather than full colour, so which branches can sell the colour booking
still depends on the sign-off table. The page does not promise every door at every branch,
so nothing here overstates it.

---

## Revision pass, 24 Aug 2026, morning (Kate)

*Three items below are superseded by the Motor City section above: the hero support line,
Motor City being out of the select, and the schema carrying three branches rather than four.*

Rebuilt against **A Proper Look, Campaign Framework** (canonical copy in Kate's workspace,
`88975ef7d53d82deacd4816fb414aaed`), specifically the **Layer 5 resolutions (all seventeen)**,
**Product architecture** and **Belief 5 locked wording** pages, all dated 24 Aug. The folder
moved from `unhurried-hour/` to `a-proper-look/` and the `_css/pages.json` key moved with it.

**Two copies exist, and both were revised on 24 Aug.** This standalone folder
(`a-proper-look-page/`) is the source-separated hand-off package: one HTML file, four
stylesheets, five scripts, nothing inlined. The other is `tara-rose-pages-main/a-proper-look/`,
where `build.py` inlines the CSS. Keep them in sync; edit here first, then port the markup.
In this folder the page stylesheet was renamed `css/unhurried-hour.css` to `css/a-proper-look.css`,
and `js/tracking.js` carries the `APL-` session ref and the new tag derivation.

What changed, by resolution:

- **Name and URL (items 1, 47).** The Unhurried Hour is retired. Canonical is now
  `/en/ae/a-proper-look/`. Title is the findable name, `A Proper Look · Tara Rose Salon`;
  the H1 stays the emotional line, deliberately different (item 49).
- **Hero option 1 (item 46).** H1 "Nobody will be watching the clock." with the spec sub-line
  and the support line `A Proper Look · AED 300 · Khalifa City · Saadiyat · Al Quoz`.
- **Abu Dhabi in, and the anchor (items 42 to 45).** Salon select now carries Khalifa City A,
  Mamsha Al Saadiyat, Al Quoz 1 and "Either Abu Dhabi salon is fine". "Either Dubai salon"
  is retired. Motor City is out of the select entirely, with the C6 sentence under it and a
  waiting-list checkbox (`motor_city_wait`) so "we'll tell you" has a capture behind it.
- **Two products (item 72, Product architecture).** A Proper Look at AED 300 is the featured
  entry card with its own CTA; the three doors follow at From 570 / 400 / 765 (item 79's
  Medium correction noted; From prices are Short). AED 380/150/620 are gone, and nothing
  advertises AED 150 anywhere.
- **Belief 5 (items 5, 27).** Every "fewer years" sentence is out. The 2a page sentence sits
  above the price in `#start`, verbatim except the banned em dash. The FAQ carries the §3
  reception answer verbatim as "Is a junior stylist less experienced?". `#column` and the
  founder block reframed to demand, not years.
- **FAQ (item 55).** "How long will I be there?" is the first entry, with the durations and
  the "not squeezed into the front of it" line. FAQPage schema mirrors all seven byte for byte.
- **Schema (item 50).** Three LocalBusiness nodes, one per delivering branch, each with its
  own `areaServed` and a `makesOffer` naming A Proper Look at AED 300. Motor City omitted.
- **Tags (item 48).** Hidden fields `campaign=a-proper-look`, `product`, `emirate`, `channel`,
  `branch`. Channel and branch read from the URL (GBP links carry `?channel=gbp&branch=`);
  product and emirate derive from her selections. Session ref prefix is now `APL-`.
- **Deploy (item 53).** Ships `noindex,nofollow`. The flip to index is the last action after
  the four gates, never before.
- **Availability** reworded: the "slot that would otherwise hold two appointments" claim is
  gone (untrue of a 60+15 block); the ringfence carries the scarcity honestly, still no number.

**The host question, answered 24 Aug by a live header check:** `tararosesalon.com` answers as
WordPress on LiteSpeed, which is LID's hosting. Neither GitHub Pages nor Vercel serves the
domain, so both of the framework's assumptions were wrong. The canonical URL can only exist as
a page LID mounts on the WordPress site, exactly like the live beauty voucher page, and the
noindex flip and any 301s happen there. Vercel keeps one job: hosting the preview URL that the
brand gate reviews before this folder is handed to LID.

Still open after this pass: the OG image `/og/a-proper-look.jpg` does not exist yet, founder block still needs
Tara's own words, the sign-off table backs the "signed off by a named senior" sentence (Week 1),
and the formal `trs-brand-guardian` gate runs on the preview URL before launch.

# The Unhurried Hour, original build notes (21 Aug, superseded where the section above says so)

Not shipped. Source: **Layer 5, The Landing Page Handover**, in the Notion framework
"The Unhurried Hour, Campaign Framework" (Tara's workspace, 3c2846184941818f...), read
21 Aug 2026 together with Layer 1.

This page replaces the earlier `junior/` build, which was made from the 16 July "Junior
Experience" copy before this framework was found. That page and its CSS are deleted, and
its manifest entry removed. Nothing of the old URL survives, which is correct: junior must
never be the campaign label or appear in a URL.

Built at `unhurried-hour/index.html`, registered in `_css/pages.json` as
`page-beauty-voucher.css` + `trs-core.css` + `page-unhurried.css`.

## What was built to spec

The seventeen-section spine in Layer 5 A, in order, with the ids the manifest names:
nav, `#hero`, `#credibility`, `#clock`, `#water`, `#column`, `#hour`, `#truth`, `#founder`,
`#awards`, `#reviews`, `#promise`, `#availability`, `#start`, `#book`, `#faq`, footer.

- **Hero**: Option 1, the one Layer 5 B says to ship. No price in the supporting line.
- **The junior answer at section 6**, before the science pays off and eight sections before
  the first price, with "That was never yours to work out alone." verbatim and the boundary
  line about the trade running against you on years on the floor.
- **Price after proof.** Exactly three from-prices, at section 14, after founder, awards,
  reviews and the Confidence Promise. Zero price tokens above that point.
- **Two reviews only**, Marelize and Sannah, verbatim, both naming female stylists.
- **The Confidence Promise band**, verbatim, once. The word "guarantee" appears nowhere.
- **Availability** carries no number and no countdown, because Ops has not supplied a real
  hours-per-week figure and the spec forbids inventing one.
- **Sticky bar** under 768 only, IntersectionObserver not scroll maths, hidden over `#book`
  and the footer, fade only under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Form**: nine fields, real `<label>` on every one, 16px floor inherited from trs-core,
  submit disabled until valid, "Who should we thank?" revealed on "a friend told me".
- **Tracking**: every hidden field in Layer 5 F.1 present and populated, plus a `UH-XXXX`
  session ref appended to every wa.me prefill so a WhatsApp thread matches a session.

Verified in a real browser at 375, 768, 834, 1280 and 1920: no horizontal page scroll at
any width, hero pill above the fold at 375x667 (lands at 602) and at 1280x800 (582), no nav
collision at 1280, doors at 1/2/3 columns, sticky bar present under 768 and absent above,
every input at or above 16px, every tap target at or above 44px, no dead `#` anchor.

## Two contradictions in the source. Both need Tara, not a build decision.

**1. AED 150.** Layer 1 says the non-negotiable move is that the campaign stops advertising
AED 130 and AED 150, because at the stated CPL and conversion targets a 5x multiplier needs
a first-visit bill of AED 389 to 556, and AED 150 returns 1.4x, inside the playbook's own
red band. Layer 5 D then puts **From AED 150** on entry card 2 as the advertised price.
Those cannot both hold. The page currently carries Layer 5's figure, because Layer 5 is the
page spec, but this is the single most expensive open item on the page.

**2. The three doors do not match between layers.**

| | Layer 1, the three doors | Layer 5 D, the entry cards |
|---|---|---|
| Colour | AED 570, "gone by week three" | From AED 380 |
| Second door | AED 400, the diagnostic door, database and retargeting only | From AED 150, breakage and snapping |
| Keratin | AED 765, high-intent search only | From AED 620, frizz |

Layer 1 also restricts doors 2 and 3 to database, retargeting and high-intent search, and
names door 1 as the only paid door. Layer 5 gives all three an equal card and an equal
button. The page follows Layer 5. If Layer 1's channel rule stands, cards 2 and 3 need
either a different treatment or a different page.

**3. The limescale analogy. SETTLED, 21 Aug 2026.** Layer 5 section 5 prescribes "the
limescale on your shower screen". Brand review ruled that cannot be carved out: limescale is
named in the ban list and a shower screen is a household analogy, and that ban is what
retired the old hero. So the spec loses this one. `#water` now carries the approved beauty
equivalent instead, once: *"like old make-up that never fully came off"*.

## Gates still open, and what each one blocks

| Layer 5 ref | Item | Blocks |
|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | Which host serves tararosesalon.com, Vercel or GitHub Pages. The infrastructure audit says one, the technical-lead skill says the other | All four required 301s. **None are built.** A client-side stub leaks a hop of link equity, so this decides the method, not just the file |
| 0.2 | Can either Abu Dhabi salon actually deliver the hour | The page ships **Dubai only**, Al Quoz and Motor City, in the hero support line, the salon select, the footer and the Service schema. Until this is answered, **Abu Dhabi must come out of Meta geo targeting**, per the spec's own rule: never list a salon to keep an ad set alive |
| 5 | A dated, citable source for the mineral figure | The ppm number. The page says "among the highest mineral levels in the world" with no number, which is the spec's stated fallback |
| 13 | Real unhurried hours per week per salon | The availability section carries the honest shape of the claim but no figure |
| I.1 | The operational definition of "the hour": 60 minutes of consultation, or a 90-minute slot with a protected 20-minute consult | Rostering, and the promise the page is making |
| I.11 | Whether every stylist in the column has genuinely trained in all eight categories, the UAE diagnostics and the consultation method | A verifiable factual claim about staff. It is on the page in section 6 and in the FAQ. If it is true of most but not all, the sentence narrows before launch |
| 8 | The dark pull line is a candidate, and Layer 5 says gate it through trs-brand-guardian before build | One sentence |
| 9 | The founder block is written to the direction in Layer 5, not in Tara's own words | Her sign-off, or her voice note |
| 16 | Layer 5 says the six FAQ replacements are "in H", but H is the SEO section and does not contain them. The six on the page were written from the doctrine and the section briefs | Sign-off. The FAQPage schema mirrors them verbatim, so a wording change is two edits |

## Where this build departs from Layer 5, deliberately

- **`/menu/` is not built, and the links to it are removed.** The spec puts a menu link in
  `#start` and in the footer. Both are out until the page exists, on brand review's block:
  see the photography and review sections below. When it is built it inherits every rule on
  this one, no percentage-off, no "Save AED", a course priced as a course. That rewrite
  covers the old headings "Keratin Smoothing 30% Off", "Colour Packages (50% off treatment)",
  "Blowdry Edit x3 (20% off)" and "Treatment Courses 30% Off", and every Save AED cell.
- **`page-manifest.json` is not emitted.** Layer 5 assumes a build system with
  `_content/tokens.json`, `_content/uae.json` and `./build.sh`. This repo is the live page
  tree: `_css/*.css` plus `build.py`, inlining CSS into each page. So prices and the salon
  list are typed into the page rather than driven from `uae.json`, and the
  `price_tokens` sum-to-nine assertion is not enforced by a build step. It holds today,
  checked in the browser: three from-prices, nothing above section 14.
- **Consent wording and the GA4/GHL event spec are incomplete.** Parts of Layer 5 F and G
  could not be read out of Notion, so the consent copy on the form is the house wording from
  the voucher page rather than the exact strings the spec names. Check F and G before launch.
- **The `<TRS.Environment/>` four-card module** does not exist in this repo, so section 5
  uses the standard three-card `grid-3`, dropping the Maintenance card.
- **The photography is interim.** The hero is `hero-mapping.jpg`, a stylist working at the
  mirror station. It replaced `exp-floor.jpg`, which is two women with a laptop at a window
  and reads as a meeting, not a hair appointment. The `#hour` rail uses `exp-authentic`,
  `exp-colour` and `exp-people`. All four are real salon shots already in the repo, and all
  four are placeholders for the right ones. See the photography section below.
- **The OG image at `/og/unhurried-hour.jpg?v=1` does not exist.** Every share renders blank
  until it does. Spec: 1200 x 630, JPEG q80 or WebP, 200KB or under, the hero photograph.
- **The two `/menu/` links are removed from the page**, not just unbuilt. Brand review, 21 Aug,
  blocked them: a visible "every price, every length" link landing on a 404, directly under
  three from-prices, undoes the trust the fourteen sections above it built. They go back the
  day `/en/ae/unhurried-hour/menu/` ships clean.

## Photography

The right source is Tara's own curated library, shared to kate@:
**Shared with me > TARA FOUND IMAGES**, sorted into BLONDES, CONSULTATIONS:INTERACTION,
EDUCATION, EXTENSIONS, HOMECARE, JUNIOR STYLIST, SALON IMAGES, TEAM, TREATMENTS.
`CONSULTATIONS:INTERACTION` is the folder this campaign is about.

Wanted, and why:

| File | Folder | Slot |
|---|---|---|
| `1.png` | CONSULTATIONS:INTERACTION | Hero. Stylist holding a section of the client's hair, client's face visible in the mirror. Matches the Layer 5 hero brief almost exactly |
| `BRIT6639.jpg` | JUNIOR STYLIST | Rail, "then she looks properly". Stylist leaning in over the client, product in hand |
| `10.png` | CONSULTATIONS:INTERACTION | Rail, "then she explains it". Stylist mid-explanation, comb in hand |

Two cautions. The `.png` names suggest screen-grabs, so if either lands under about 1400px
wide the hero needs a BRIT original instead. And do not pull from
**Tish tash marketing content, Tara Rose Bahrain**: that is the wrong market for this page.

Those files could not be fetched from this session. The tara@ folders are private to her and
Chrome here is signed in as kate@; the accounts that can read them return text or base64, and
a 6MB JPEG through a tool result is not viable. They need downloading by hand.

## Brand review, 21 Aug 2026

`trs-brand-guardian` v3.2. Verdict **FIX FIRST, then ESCALATE TO TARA**. Score 71/100.
All seven blocks cleared the same day, in both copies:

1. "Refine, never refund." deleted. Internal doctrine printed as client copy, and it plants
   the word refund at the moment the band is buying her trust.
2. `#hour` now names the **8-Step Hair Plan**. The numbered One-to-Five labels became
   First / Then / Then / Then / Last, because a numbered five beside a named eight invites
   the retired five-step reading.
3. `#truth` no longer attributes the line to "Tara Rose". A brand is not a speaker. The slot
   now carries the rhythm block 5 eyebrow, which was the only block heading missing. If Tara
   confirms the words are hers, the attribution is "Tara Rose Kidd".
4. Entry card 3: "cuticle" and "fills the porosity" out. Trichology register plus an absolute
   efficacy claim, in the highest-stakes sentence on the page.
5. Entry card 2: "through the cortex" out.
6. `#water`: "pigment" out.
7. Both `/menu/` links removed. See above.

Plus, on the review's ruling: **the limescale analogy stays out.** limescale is named in the
ban list and a shower screen is a household analogy, so the Layer 5 line cannot be carved
out. But zero analogies under-delivers against "one analogy, then stop", so `#water` now
carries the approved beauty equivalent: *"like old make-up that never fully came off"*, once.

Soft fixes also taken: "Not her fault" to "Not your fault" (the page says "you" throughout);
"stops it lifting" to "holds it longer"; "not the same appointment for less money" cut from
the FAQ so `#column` carries it alone; the Confidence Promise stated once, with the FAQ
pointing at the band; every HTML comment stripped, because build commentary ships in
view-source; the schema apostrophe mirrored so the FAQ pair matches byte for byte; one
`HairSalon` node with two addresses split into two nodes with distinct `@id`s; and the
footer's company LinkedIn and YouTube moved out from under Tara's name.

**Still escalated, not fixable by edit:** the AED 150 contradiction, `#founder` being Tara's
first person but not Tara's words, the three doors disagreeing between layers, and the claims
table below.

### Claims on this page nobody has signed off as true

Every row is a factual assertion to a paying stranger, and none is verifiable from this repo.

- "among the highest mineral levels in the world" (no dated citable source)
- every stylist in the column trained in all eight categories, the UAE diagnostics and the
  consultation method. If true of most but not all, the sentence narrows before launch
- an unhurried hour "sits in a slot that would otherwise hold two appointments"
- "It is ringfenced. Nobody can book over it to catch up."
- the six awards in `#awards`
- "Eleven years, four salons"
- the four "As featured in" outlets, and their four live URLs
- five stars on both reviews
- AED 380 / 150 / 620
- that our own senior column is "booked to the minute" and cuts the consultation first.
  This one is published self-criticism of the highest-margin column. Founder-voiced honesty
  is on brand, but it needs her word, not ours.
